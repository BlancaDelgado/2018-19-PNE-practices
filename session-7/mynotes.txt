PROGRAMMING NETWORKS
......................................................................................................................


To communicate programs there are many models (ex. client-server model).

---------------
CLIENT-SERVER MODEL
---------------

Client: starts communication and sends message to server (it NEEDS the server).
Server: takes message from many clients and responds (it takes requests even if there are no clients connected yet).


INTERNET
-----

Clients and servers are connected through networks - the internet.


--IS COMMUNICATION WORKING?

To check if the communication works, you can write 'ping <IP Address>' at the terminal. Stop it with CtrlC.

Each line is a message (ping) from our computer to the server, and the time it takes to establish the communication
(times are more or less the same, but the never the same, because internet is a chaotic network).

Using this command you can estimate how far are the two computers communicating each other.

In the internet, everything works with IP Addresses. You can connect with any machine using this.

Example.-   bdelgado@lambda03:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
            PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=121 time=3.61 ms
            64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=121 time=3.57 ms


--IP ADDRESS.

All computers connected to internet have one or more network interfaces, each with an IP ADDRESS. This identification
may change depending on where the computer is being connected.

Example.-   My phone IP address at URJC is 10.0.54.93 (you can check it at wifi settings).
            My computer IP address at URJC is 212.128.253.67 (you can check it at the terminal with 'ifconfig').
            My teacher's computer IP address at URJC is 212.128.253.64.


--URL.

To identify machine interfaces for humans, we can use URLs. They also have IP Addresses!

Example.-   bdelgado@lambda03:~$ ping www.google.com
            PING www.google.com (216.58.211.228) 56(84) bytes of data.
            64 bytes from mad01s24-in-f228.1e100.net (216.58.211.228): icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=3.98 ms
            64 bytes from mad01s24-in-f228.1e100.net (216.58.211.228): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=3.70 ms


--PORT.

This number identifies specific servers within IP addresses. For web servers, we usually use port 80.
If you don't specify ports, communication will be refused.


-- WRITING AND READING.

Example.    NAME = 'mynotes.txt'
            myfile = open(NAME, 'r')
            print('File opened: {}'.format(myfile.name))
            contents = myfile.read()

Example.    You can read or write from and to the file with python programs as many times as you execute the programs.


-- SOCKETS.
